# healthCarrier

- Parse different graphs (cities) from files

- The objective of the project is to carry people from different locations (nodes of a graph) into a hospital (final destination).

- Each ambulance has a maximum capacity and each patient has a needed arrival time

- Tries to minimize the number of ambulances while trying to save everyone

- To find a solution it uses connectivity algorithms, A-star, 2-opt and Nearest neighbors.

- A graph visualization solution with the several paths from the ambulances is shown in the end.
